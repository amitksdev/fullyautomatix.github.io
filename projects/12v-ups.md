# 12V UPS

{:.lead}
A bench-top 12 V uninterruptible power supply built around a Li-Ion cell pack with active current limiting and a dedicated BMS for safe charge, discharge, and over-current protection.

## Build Summary

The UPS sits inline between a 12 V DC supply and a load, seamlessly switching to battery when mains power is interrupted. A hardware current-limit stage protects both the cells and the load during heavy transients.

- Li-Ion cell pack (3S configuration, 11.1 V nominal) with spot-welded nickel strips
- Dedicated BMS IC for over-charge, over-discharge, over-current, and short-circuit cut-off
- Adjustable current-limiting circuit using an op-amp sense resistor loop
- Automatic switchover relay with sub-20 ms transfer time
- LED fuel gauge and fault indicator on front panel
