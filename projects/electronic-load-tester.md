## Build Summary

This electronic load tester uses a precision op-amp control loop to drive a power MOSFET as a programmable constant-current sink. Perfect for battery discharge testing, power supply stability checks, and measuring actual capacity under realistic load conditions.

- Op-amp feedback loop maintains constant current through MOSFET
- Precision current sense resistor (0.1Ω / 5W) for accurate measurement
- Adjustable load current from 0.1A to 5A via rotary encoder
- OLED display shows real-time voltage, current, power, and mAh discharged
- Over-temperature shutdown using NTC thermistor on MOSFET heatsink
- Arduino Nano for control, measurement, and data logging to SD card
