# Auto-Off Timer

{:.lead}
A compact mains-connected auto-off timer built around the C005 timer IC, a relay output stage, and a transformerless capacitive power supply — no bulky adapters required.

## Build Summary

The timer counts down a user-set period and switches off the load via a relay. The entire circuit runs from a capacitive dropper supply directly off mains, keeping the footprint to a single compact PCB.

- C005 timer IC driving a single-pole relay for load switching
- Capacitive power supply (X-rated cap dropper) — no transformer
- Onboard Zener regulation for stable 5 V logic rail
- Preset resistor network for fixed time intervals (15 / 30 / 60 min)
- LED indicator shows active countdown state
- Compact single-layer PCB fits a standard wall-plate enclosure
